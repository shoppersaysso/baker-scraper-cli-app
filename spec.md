# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
	I have created a CLI that starts with a greeting and directs the user through each menu option, always giving the option to start over, go back one, or exit. Once you exit or get to the end of options, the CLI gives a goodbye message and exits the application.
- [X] Pull data from an external source
	The data is being pulled from the website www.joythebaker.com.
- [X] Implement both list and detail views
	The initial category list is a simple scrape and then the recipe list for each cateory is more detailed.
