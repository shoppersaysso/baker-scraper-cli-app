# BakerScraper

Welcome to the Joy the Baker Scraper app!

This app scrapes the recipe categories, titles, and links from the baking blog, www.joythebaker.com.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'baker_scraper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install baker_scraper

## Usage

www.joythebaker.com is a popular website featuring recipes in a blog format. But sometimes you want to go right to the recipe and skip the whole blog post. The Joy the Baker Scraper app does just that. Easily navigate through recipe categories to find the desired recipe. Once you find the recipe, select it to go straight to the URL.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
